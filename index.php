		<h2>DIY PC Builder</h2>
			<h3>A student on a budget</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
				DIY PC Builder has been building PCs since she was 12 years old.  She knows what types of 				computer components she wants to include in her next build - a computer for school work and gaming.
				</p>
			<h4>Needs</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Meet minimum requirements for build
						<ul>
							<li>correct amount of RAM</li>
							<li>compatible with system build</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Keep the RAM chip cost below 60$ to fit budget</li>
					<li>Get the best possible product based on user ratings</li>
				</ol>
			<h4>Frustrations</h4>
				<p>
					DIY PC Builder dislikes doing the time consuming research necessary to purchase individual computer components for a complete computer build.  The RAM chip she will ultimately decide to purchase should be compatible with her motherboard and also be the best rated by other experienced PC Builders.
